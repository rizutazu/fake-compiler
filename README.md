# Fake Compiler

Pretend as if something is compiling or busying in your terminal.

## Usage
- Run compiler: `run` subcommand
  - run over a directory: `fake-compiler run -d path_to_compile -C compiler_type ` 
    - currently, only `cxx` compiler_type is implemented, which looks like cmake compiling logs
    - `fake-compiler` will iterate through the whole `path_to_compile` directory and print compiling logs of files with `.cpp/.c/.S` extension
  - or run with a config file: `fake-compiler run -c config_file`
    - the config file contains the iteration result of some directory, it has specific format and is generated by `fake-compiler gen` subcommand
    - this is essentially equivalent to `-d` option, except that `fake-compiler` now no longer needs to explicitly iterate through some directory everytime
  - optional flag: `-t threads`: specify the number of threads, default: 16
    - since `fake-compiler` does not actually do the compiling stuff, this flag essentially specifies how much threads is sleeping at the same time
- Generate config file: `gen` subcommand
  - `fake-compiler gen -C compiler_type -d path_to_compile -o output_file`
    - the generated config file is bound to specified compiler_type

This repository is shipped with an example config file: `linux-6.12.17_cxx`, generated over linux 6.12.17 source code with `cxx` compiler_type. Try it (need Go environment): `go run . run -c linux-6.12.17_cxx`

## Build

1. setup Go environment
2. `make build`
